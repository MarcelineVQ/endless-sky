# permadeath-mode

In this branch are fixes for the regular game and additional gameplay modes to enhance your play.

In the player's save file is a new section called modes where these are enabled. UI support to enable them ingame is in the works.  
e.g.:
```
pilot Scroopy Noopers
date 22 8 3014
system "Tania Australis"
planet Ingot
clearance
modes
	permadeath
	hardcore
...
```

Hardcore Mode forces you to only use one save file while in game for the pilot who has it set. Got a bad habbit of save-scumming? Beat it with Hardcore Mode! This mode also makes ship losses permanent.

Permadeath Mode will delete all of a pilot's save files any time that pilot dies. This is THE way to play the game, every outfit choice you make matters.  
Eventually it will include a sort of leaderboard that keeps track of your deceased captains, tracking their final net worth, combat ranking, licenses, flagship, and possibly more.


# endless-sky

Explore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own...

Endless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite, Escape Velocity, or Star Control. You start out as the captain of a tiny space ship and can choose what to do from there. The game includes a major plot line and many minor missions, but you can choose whether you want to play through the plot or strike out on your own as a merchant or bounty hunter or explorer.
